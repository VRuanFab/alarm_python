My very first test coding in python, i tried to make an simple alarm using schedule and win11toast.

How to use: executing the main.py, it will ask you when you wanna be "advised"
1 - beggining with hour (you can put any number between 0 and 23) and press "enter"
2 - now you put minute (you can put any number between 0 and 59) and "enter" again
3 - finishing the last step, it will ask you the title of your alarm (exemple: "feed my dog")

(i've got plans to make it better but for now is that)
